# EasyBrowser

A simple web browsing app with an action sheet popup that allows only two websites to be viewed based on their host name. The app contains an open button at the top to toggle websites to be opened. It also contains a refresh button and a progress bar at the bottom, which are seperated by flexible spacing.
